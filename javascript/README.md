TO COMPILE AND RUN (Node.js needed https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
    numbers chosen are given as parameters in this javascript version,
    for example:
	
    node Lotto.js 1 4 12 13 25 36 39 
    
    NOTE: Generating the 7-win row may take a while.

INFO

Since I uploaded the java version, I decided to include this smaller javascript version as well.

The exercise was one of the first week's exercises in Autumn 2020 in TAMK during
a course about EcmaScript.

We were asked to do a Lotto App where you can choose Lotto numbers and the program will tell you how
many years it takes for you to hit the jackpot. 

The app is based on settings used in Finland by Veikkaus, where you must choose 7 unique numbers
between 1 and 40.
